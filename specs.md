Product Communication Strategy – Farm management & operations
Today, we have a very fragmented initiative for FarmOnline+ and no clear approach to communication.  The communication we have is following legacy blueprints from our and are not ideal for modern communication of digital platforms, if in doubt what we mean look into MTech Systems and Billwerk. 
Value first
The goal of this communication strategy is to position FarmOnline+ as the world's leading data-driven management system within our industry, through implanting value first communication. Here we emphasize actionable insights, operational efficiency, and animal welfare to drive subscriptions revenue and engagement. Unlike competitors, FarmOnline+ combines hardware reliability with advanced data-driven insights. This dual strength makes SKOV the complete ecosystem provider. Specifically 
Audience
1.	Farm managers
2.	Integrators / investors
3.	Service technicians
4.	Internal employees
Our communication must be very clear as to who we wish to target. We must emphasize the benefits, why they are benefits, and to whom each benefit is relevant. Currently, within SKOV and arguably our audiences, it is very unclear who we wish to target and why. Currently, the available licenses bring various features and applications. However, the link to specific utility is hard to discover.
Testimonials, examples, and provision of real-life relatability 
Specifically, the messaging is to focus on real customer outcomes with vibrant claims backed up by data and testimonials. All communication must highlight tangible results – such as financial benefits, reduced mortality rate, and fewer emergency service visits due to the alarm systems and remote access features. 

Be more transparent about the idea and the technological arguments
In addition, the messaging should be that our business software completes our farm equipment business and ensure that customers have a great overview of how things fit together, incentivizing investment in the complete SKOV offering, and a good overview of how that offering fits into the customer overall system landscape. It should be very clear to the customers that FarmOnline+ is the new generation of farm management – indicating the new generation aspect of it should automatically lead to the explanation of the fact that FarmOnline+ is a constantly developing phenomenon that requires day-to-day tecnhological improvements and updates, ensuring the future of farm management. What is also important to mention is that all of these new features that are based on the newest software developments will ensure proactiveness rather than reactiveness – leading to savings, less mortality, higher productivity, and less maintenance.
We are committed to our vision of building the worlds ...
User experience benefits + Training
Last, we would like to move toward more self-service and ease of setup, onboarding and use (think DIY end-to end, think Samsung tv and Netflix on the tv). This should portray FarmOnline+ as something that is easy to install, understand, and use. 
Our messaging should be that our solutions fits and adapts easy from novice to expert, promoting a natural progression and learning path. 
Training & security – dedicated learning path - if you need help, we have all the help and remedies to help you – Maybe regional or global
However, training must not be neglected. The ease of using FarmOnline+ arguably only comes from proper training. The airplane industry is a great example of how things can go fatally wrong when neglecting training and assuming that pilots are capable of handling “easy” features (Boeing 737-Max scandal). It cost almost 400 human lives – in this industry, it can result in thousands of animal casualties – and potentially bring an enormous scandal upon SKOV.
However, if we communicate that training is necessary, it can demotivate customers (training costs, and can perhaps be time-consuming. Therefore, we must decide whether or not to communicate about training – is it necessary or not? Careful decision is important here – Asians bought licences, but never used it due to lack of training. Thus, both strategies can be harmful – depending on the geographical location, needs, and culture.

Emotional appealing and language 
Moving forward, we must apply more storytelling in our communication efforts. We must speak to their feelings and logic. Here, we must signal that we speak and understand the farmers day-to-day operations. We must speak the same language, and we need to show that we care about our potential customers. 
We must apply hidden triggers for controversial topics such as efficiency gains and headcount reductions achieved, with neutralizing languages e.g. “with remote management you can free up time engaged in trivial task and instead focus in what matters most”

Tactic/method:
Create a dedicated content-path for farm operations with problem-solution sections (e.g., “Solve climate control issues with real-time alerts”).
Under the head section “Farm Management”, more subsections are needed – such as “Bundles, applications, pricings - 
The head section is to function as a pathway to the subcategories

7. Revamped Trade Show & Showroom presence 
Strategy: 
Based on the approaches taken from the above steps, we need to align our tradeshow presense to follow the messaging patterns. Here we need to ensure that sales managers and efficiently go from very broad discussions based on clear system drawings, down to concrete problem-solution communication with customers.  
Further it should be a clear objective to sign customer up to upcoming webinars and potential demonstration depending on relative interest. 
Tactic:
Set up touchscreens with live FarmOnline+ demos and distribute QR-coded, problem-solution focused flyers linking to trials. Train staff to emphasize benefits of modernizing operations by providing clear talking points.
