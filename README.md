# FarmOnline+ Website - Complete Documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development (Local)
```bash
npm run dev
```
This opens the component-based development version at `index-dev.html`

### Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run deploy
```
This automatically:
1. Builds a single-file version with all components inline
2. Replaces `index.html` with the built version
3. Commits and pushes to GitHub Pages

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

The FarmOnline+ website uses a **Hierarchical Single-Page Application (SPA)** architecture with **component-based modular design** and **dynamic content switching**.

### **Core Concepts:**
- **HOC (Higher-Order Components)**: Reusable UI components that can be composed together
- **Content Sections**: Main navigation areas that contain related components
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Multi-level navigation system with main tabs and submenus
- **Component Embedding**: Build-time component composition for GitHub Pages deployment

### **✅ SAFE UPDATE Operations:**

#### **Content Updates:**
```bash
# Edit any component file directly
components/management/hero.html          # Operations hero content
components/integration/sections.html    # Integration content  
components/infrastructure/sections.html # Infrastructure content
components/applications/sections.html   # Applications content
components/sections/pricing.html        # Shared pricing content
components/sections/contact.html        # Shared contact content
```

#### **Safe Workflow:**
```bash
1. Edit component files in components/ directory
2. Test: npm run dev
3. Deploy: .\deploy-github-pages.ps1  
4. Verify: https://skovnbo.github.io/FarmOnline-/
```

### **❌ NEVER DO:**
- ❌ Edit `index.html` directly (gets overwritten by deploy script)
- ❌ Remove content-section divs from `index-dev.html`
- ❌ Change data-section attributes without updating navigation
- ❌ Modify main.js navigation logic without understanding the flow
