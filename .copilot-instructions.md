# GitHub Copilot Instructions for FarmOnline+ Website Project

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is the **FarmOnline+ Website** - a marketing website for SKOV A/S's FarmOnline+ farm management platform. The website uses a **Hierarchical Single-Page Application (SPA)** architecture with **component-based modular design**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

- **Fully Independent Sections**: Each main section is completely self-contained
- **No Shared Components**: Every section has its own pricing and contact components
- **HOC (Higher-Order Components)**: Reusable UI components within each section
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Multi-level navigation with main tabs and submenus
- **Component Embedding**: Build-time component composition for GitHub Pages
- **Development vs Production**: `index-dev.html` for dev, `index.html` auto-generated for production

## 🚨 Critical Rules

### ❌ NEVER CREATE .MD FILES
- **NO .md summaries, reports, or documentation files**
- **All documentation goes in README.md** 
- **Use comments in code for technical notes**
- **Create .txt files only if absolutely necessary for data**

### ❌ NEVER EDIT DIRECTLY
- `index.html` - Auto-generated by deploy script
- `package-lock.json` - Managed by npm

### ✅ SAFE TO EDIT
- Any file in `components/` directory
- `index-dev.html` - Development template
- `scripts/main.js` - Navigation logic
- `styles/main.css` - Styling
- `README.md` - Documentation updates

## � Development Workflow

1. **Development Server**: `npm run dev` - runs on localhost:3000 with component loading
2. **Component Updates**: Edit files in `components/` and refresh browser
3. **Production Build**: Run `deploy-github-pages.ps1` to generate production `index.html`
4. **Deployment**: Commit and push changes to deploy via GitHub Pages

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Complete Section Independence**: Each section (management, integration, infrastructure, applications) is 100% self-contained
2. **No Shared Components**: Every section has its own pricing and contact components (except navigation)
3. **Specialized Content**: Each section's pricing and contact is tailored to that domain
4. **HOC Pattern**: Components are reusable within their sections
5. **Build-Time Composition**: Components are embedded during build for static hosting
6. **Documentation Unity**: README.md is the single source of truth for all documentation

## 🗺️ Navigation Architecture

### Main Sections
1. **Operations** (`data-section="operations"`) - Farm management tools
2. **Integration** (`data-section="integration"`) - Data analytics and APIs  
3. **Infrastructure** (`data-section="infrastructure"`) - Technical infrastructure
4. **Applications** (`data-section="applications"`) - Mobile and web applications

### Component Mapping (All Sections Fully Independent)
- **Operations**: Uses `components/management/` files (hero, overview, features, benefits, pricing, contact)
- **Integration**: Uses `components/integration/` files (sections, pricing, contact)
- **Infrastructure**: Uses `components/infrastructure/` files (sections, pricing, contact)
- **Applications**: Uses `components/applications/` files (sections, mobile-app, survey-webapp, pricing, contact)
- **Navigation**: Uses `components/navigation/nav.html` (shared navigation only)

### Complete Section Independence
- Each section has its own specialized pricing and contact components
- No shared components between sections (except navigation)
- Each pricing component tailored to section's domain expertise
- Each contact component routes to appropriate specialists

## 🎨 Content Guidelines

### Target Audience
- **Farm Managers**: Operational efficiency and cost savings
- **Integrators/Investors**: ROI and scalability features

- **Build**: Vite 5.0+ for development
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons
- **Typography**: Inter font
- **Colors**: SKOV brand blue (#0066cc), secondary green (#00a651)

## 💡 Common Tasks

### Adding New Content
1. Edit appropriate component file in `components/`
2. Test with `npm run dev`
3. Deploy with `.\deploy-github-pages.ps1`

### Navigation Changes
1. Update `components/navigation/nav.html`
2. Ensure section IDs match navigation links
3. Test all navigation paths

### Content Updates
- Hero sections: `components/management/hero.html`
- Features: respective section's component files
- Shared content: `components/sections/pricing.html` or `contact.html`

## 🎯 Success Metrics Focus

When suggesting content improvements, emphasize:
- **Concrete benefits**: "15% energy savings", "12% feed waste reduction"
- **Operational efficiency**: Time savings, automation benefits
- **ROI and cost savings**: Measurable business impact
- **Scalability**: Multi-farm, multi-country capabilities
- **Integration**: Seamless system connections

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

- **Development**: Always test with `npm run dev` first
- **Production**: Use `.\deploy-github-pages.ps1` for deployment
